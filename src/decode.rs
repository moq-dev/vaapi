//! Thin VA-API H.264 decoder built on the vendored libva binding.
//!
//! The mirror of [`crate::encode`]. It reuses the backend-agnostic bitstream
//! layer ([`crate::codec::h264`]) from discord/cros-codecs (BSD-3-Clause) for
//! SPS/PPS/slice parsing, reference marking, and DPB bumping, then drives libva
//! directly rather than vendoring cros-codecs's generic multi-backend decoder
//! framework. The per-picture and per-slice VA buffer population is ported from
//! cros-codecs's `decoder/stateless/h264/vaapi.rs`.
//!
//! Feed [`Decoder::decode`] one Annex-B access unit at a time. Its picture is
//! submitted and completed before the call returns, rather than when the next
//! unit's first slice arrives, so the hardware is never left holding a
//! half-submitted picture between calls.
//!
//! Output trails input, and by more than the stream's reorder depth: C.4.5.3
//! bumps the DPB only when a new picture needs the slot, so the delay follows
//! the sequence's reference and reorder limits. A stream coded with three
//! reference frames trails by three pictures whether or not it uses B-frames.
//! [`Frame`] therefore carries the timestamp of the access unit it was coded in,
//! and [`Decoder::flush`] is what releases the tail at the end of a stream.
//!
//! Progressive 8-bit 4:2:0 only: a sequence that is interlaced, deeper than 8
//! bits, or not 4:2:0 is rejected rather than decoded wrongly. That covers every
//! stream this crate's encoder, WebRTC, or a browser's `VideoEncoder` produces.
//! Left and top cropping are rejected; right and bottom cropping are supported.
